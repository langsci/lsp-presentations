Publicly funded research is very often not accessible to the public because of paywalls. Big commercial publishers put price tags of 30 EUR or more on a simple article. But the real costs of putting that article online are only a fraction of that. At the same time, and paradoxically, researchers keep submitting their research to the very journals whose publishers they so much hate. Why is that, and what could be done about it?

This talk presents case studies from physics (<a href="https://scoap3.org/">SCOAPÂ³</a> and <a href="https://scipost.org/">SciPost</a>) and linguistics (<a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org">Glossa and <a href="http://langsci-press.org/">LangSci Press</a>) which show how a research community can wrest back control from the publishers, leading to better global access to research, (raw) data, and processes.  The technology part is reasonably trivial and can be considered solved. The crucial points are rather community engagement, prestige, and long-term sustainability. (Hence we choose the society track rather than the science track). 

In our case study, both the sciences (in the case of Physics) and the humanities (in the case of Linguistics) have independently adopted very similar approaches. These involve 
<ol>
<li> close integration of the community in the whole publication process (writing, reviewing, typesetting, reviewing),</li>
<li> a commitment to openness in all domains (open access, open source, open review, open business data), and</li>
<li> a not-for-profit scholarly-owned legal setup. Furthermore, they all take a top-down approach in the domain of prestige: get the best articles first and the rest will follow, rather than the other way round. </li>
</ol>

The three principles mentioned above (community, openness, non-commercial) for the projects in physics and linguistics are reminiscenent of what we find in open source software development. It comes as no surprise that as a consequence other FLOSS techniques like versioning, feature requests, tests or forks are then also easily transferred to the production of scientific publications. Next to making the whole process of distributing knowledge more efficient and more accountable, it also empowers the average citizen as they can now interact with resarch output in well-defined ways, paving the way to Open Educational Resources via projects such as <a href="https://paperhive.org/">paperhive.org</a> or <a href="http://docloop.net/">docloop.net</a> on the one hand, and also the actual contribution via Citizen Science on the other hand.
