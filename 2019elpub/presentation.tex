    \item Open Publishing is concerned with making all aspects of publishing open (Rob Cartolano)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Open source platforms 
      \item Open formats 
      \item Open protocols
      \item Open bookkeeping

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proofreaders fall into two types. Type 1 will focus on small details; type 2 will focus on the big picture. }
    \item \textbf{Proofreading will diminish as the proofreader moves along. Comments will become shorter due to fatigue, i.e. average comment length will go down due to repetition of previous remarks as ``see above''.}

    rank all participating proofreaders by amount of comments

  \item 12 proofreaders participated 
  \item their respective ranks are given by the dots. 
  \begin{itemize}

proofreaders with more comments have shorter comments

          \item compute relative length (e.g. 0.67 of the average)
          \item compute relative position (front, middle, back)
          \item store the tuple (relative position, relative length)
          \item A dot at (0.5, 5) means that there was a comment in the middle of the relevant stretch whose length was 5 times the average comment length. 
        \end{itemize}
\item the relative position can be pegged to the linear order of comments, or to the pages

  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Hypothesis is confirmed

      \item the later in the document a comment is, the shorter it will be 
      \item the first comment will be about 110\% of the average, while the last one will be 90\% of the average.

\section{Discussion}
\frame{
\frametitle{Discussion}
%   \includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{./path/to/graphicsfile}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Main aim: methodological
    \item Proofreading comments are a by-product of open publishing 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In traditional publishing models, these data would not be available
    \end{itemize}
    \item Once the documents, processes, and formats are opened up, novel research questions can emerge which would not have been possible under a closed setup.  
    \item Implications for psychology of reading for instance.

\section{The ecosystem}
\frame{
\frametitle{Do researchers take on\\ different roles? }
%   \includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{./path/to/graphicsfile}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  There are 908 people with the role ``author'' at LangSci Press 
    \item There are 228 proofreaders 
    \item 27 researchers have taken up both roles
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 16 started as authors, and became proofreaders later 
      \item 11 started as proofreaders, and became authors later
      \item Movement between the author pool and the proofreader pool in both directions.

only possible for Open Access publications 
\item 
workable implementation with 50+ books and 200+ researchers
\item 
can compare to traditional proofreading 
\item 
by-product data can be used for novel research questions
\begin{itemize}
  \item proofreader typology 
  \item proofreader fatigue
\end{itemize}
\item flow back and forth between the group of authors and the group of proofreaders
\item healthy ecosystem 
\item researchers from different backgrounds at different stages of their career contribute their respective expertises to creating and improving manuscripts.
